                                                For my senior design project at U of M, I took a class called Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs. The course was focused around the technology involved with creating a mobile app and the business/logistics behind startups. My team created ARmaps, an augmented-reality mapping application for iOS to direct users to attractions within venues. For example, if you just got off your plane at a large airport, you could pull your phone out and find your next terminal with AR arrows directing you there!
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Our app was made with a Flask backend using PostgreSQL for a database, along with Terraform, AWS, and GitHub Actions for deployment. All of this was serivng our iOS app through REST API's. Most of my time was spent developing these API's to send users venues, directions, and do computation work pathfinding for the user from their current location to their end destination. However, I did get my hands on the Swift aspect of our mobile app, and helped out creating the AR arrows and the code behind placing them in the user's environment.

                                                The Wikipedia Search Engine I created has been one of my most challenging and rewarding projects yet. This project was from Michigan's EECS 485 (Web Systems), and consisted of creating a custom MapReduce framework, and then utilizing a similar version (Hadoop) to index and search through Wikipedia pages.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This was done through two processes: creating a server to run MapReduce jobs on these Wikipedia pages, and another to serve the web app using REST API's to send search results to the React frontend. Without getting into the nitty gritty details of the project, it was a fantastic exploration into data processing, information retrieval, and ultimately full-stack web development. Teaching me more than just how to do full-stack development, it was an introduction to architecture between servers and how much of the modern web is constructed.

                                                This project is a 4x4 Boggle solver CLI tool that utilizes backtracking. The inspiration for this project came from my family, and all of our time playing Boggle over quarantine. We wanted to see which words we missed on the board, so I decided to code an algorithm that would give me the solutions to any board. After considering different ways to approach this problem, I decided on a backtracking algorithm to search for solutions efficiently and store them in a space-optimized manner.

                                                Originally, the code for this project was written in C++, but has since been rewritten in C# to be used with a .NET web app. Either way, there are still improvements to be made to the project, including using a trie data structure, form validation for user-inputted boards, etc.
